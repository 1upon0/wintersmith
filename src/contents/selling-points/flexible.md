Wintersmith tries not to put any limitations on how you work with your content. You can transform it using [plugins][2] and structure it as you please.

No special directories or odd metadatafiles, just a simple directory structure. This means that you can simply throw in your old hand-crafted static site or content from other generators.

Check the [source for this site][1] or the [showcase][3] for some real-world examples.
